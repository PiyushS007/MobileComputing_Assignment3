# Accelerometer Data Visualization Android App

---

## Description

This Android application allows users to visualize accelerometer data in real-time and save that into database and after that user can export it to a CSV file for further analysis. The app consists of two screens: Screen 1 for displaying real-time accelerometer data and exporting it, and Screen 2 for visualizing the last 10 data points in a graph format.

## Features

1. **Real-time Accelerometer Data:** Users can view real-time accelerometer data (X, Y, Z) on Screen 1.
2. **Data Export:** Users can export accelerometer data to a CSV file for further analysis.
3. **Graph Visualization:** Users can visualize the last 10 accelerometer data points in a graph format on Screen 2.
